What were the main staples of diet in Gabii’s earliest phases, and how did they change over time as the settlement grew? Did the city produce most of its own food, or was it imported from the surrounding countryside, or even farther away? When did Gabii develop a centralized system of food distribution? Early results show distinct preferences for staple grains in different hut groups in the early phases of the city, as well as a lot of millet, a food found more commonly near Pompeii.
