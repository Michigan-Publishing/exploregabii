Area A occupies the north sector of the excavation site, toward the edge of the crater. Here, the excavation began in 2010 and ended in 2012. Natural erosion and plowing caused the decapitation of many of the archaeological deposits and irremediably hindered a full understanding of the areaâ€™s stratigraphy. 

A series of narrow linear cuts and several square and sub-square cuts forming a semicircular trench represent the first traces of occupation of the area during the Iron Age and Archaic period.  The linear cuts can tentatively be interpreted as channels meant to drain rain water to make the area suitable for permanent occupation, while the square cuts appear may be interpreted as settings for upright posts that could have formed a hut or another small structure. 

The excavation in the southeastern part of Area A has revealed the presence of two infant tombs of the Orientalizing period. Both were a fossa inhumation burials, where the deceased were placed in rectangular pits cut directly into the bedrock, and contained extremely rich grave goods, comprising bronze ornaments and vessels.

During the Repubblican and late Repubblican period, an elongated rectangular building opened onto a small courtyard to the west is built in area A and connected to a drainage infrastructure delimiting the property plots. Only limited traces of the house are preserved: a few walls and hardened surfaces that were either covered by proper paved floors or served to level out floors made of hardened earth. 

Following the general shrinking of the town, by the beginning of the imperial period the house had been abandoned and a large quarry for the local tuff bedrock was opened in the area.
