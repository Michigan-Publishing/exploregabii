The Gabii Project aims at representing the kind of decades-long urban excavation that has been rare in the archaeology of Italy, in contrast with projects like those at Corinth, Olympia, Ephesus or Sardis. Strengthened by the collaboration between half a dozen different North American and UK universities, the Gabii Project plans to continue the exploration of a contiguous area in the center of the city for the foreseeable future. In parallel, it intends to continue publishing its results online and in a timely fashion. The attached field school, which has already been attended by several hundred students, will continue to train the next generation of archaeologists and ancient historians.
